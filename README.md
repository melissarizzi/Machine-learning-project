# Machine Learning Project Repository
This repository is dedicated to a Machine Learning project for an exam at the University of Milan (UNIMI).
The project focuses on **Kernelized Linear Classification** and all algorithms are implemented from scratch as requested.

## Repository Structure
- **Report.pdf**: The project report, written in LaTeX, provides a comprehensive overview of the methodology, experiments, and results.
- **/code/Project.py**: The Python code is organized into classes, implementing the core algorithms and logic for the project.
- **/code/Result.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the execution of the code and visualizations of the results.
- **/Figures/**: A directory containing graphs generated during the project.
- **/Tables/**: A directory containing tables generated during the project
- **dataset.csv**: The dataset used in the project, imported from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HeP6uwyG3oMcJnViG4yCMmzmSeTa1mko/view).
